## Split data in cells
1. address > Edit column > Split into several columns…
    + Separator = `(` > OK
2. address 2 > Edit column > Split into several columns…
    + Separator = `,` (i.e. accept default and click) >  OK
3. address 2 1 > Edit column > rename this column 
    + `latitude`
4. address 2 2 > Edit column > rename this column 
    + `longitude`
(more data transformation could be done, but let’s move on for now…)


## Goal:  Concatenate cells together
1. square_feet > Edit column > Add column based on this column…
    1. New column name = `Full Description`
    2. Expression = `value + cells["proposed_work"].value`

The last step adds two columns together, but the preview screen is hard to read. Make it readable by using the next expression instead ...  

2. Expression = `value + " sq ft. " + cells["proposed_work"].value` > OK

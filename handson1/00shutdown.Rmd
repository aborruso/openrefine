It's IMPORTANT to properly shutdown the application.  OpenRefine will automatically save your project as you transform your data. **However**, in my experience your **last opertion** *may* have to be **manually saved** by following the procedures below...


**Windows**:  `Control-C`
**Mac**:  Click the OR app in the doc, invoke Quit


NOTE:  It is possible, but not garaunteed, to lose data if you don'tâ€™ follow the rather unintuitive shutdown procedures.  Better safe than sorry.

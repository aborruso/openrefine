## Goal:  Change cell type.  
Looking at the latitude and longitude cells, one column appears in green text (indicating OpenRefine considers data those cells as numbers) and one column appears in black with a closing parenthesis in the last position.  Convert both columns to text, trim leading and trailing spaces, and then find and replace the parenthesis


1. latitude > Edit cells > common transformations > To text
2. longitude > Edit cells > common transformations > Trim leading and trailing whitespace
3. longitude > Edit cells > Transformâ€¦
    + Expression = `value.replace(")","")`
